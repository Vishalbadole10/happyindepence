        Around 76 years ago, on the historic date of 15th August 1947, India became free from British domination. It was
        the culmination of numerous movements and struggles that were rife throughout the time of British rule including
        the historic revolt of 1857. This independence was achieved through the efforts of many revolutionary freedom
        fighters, who took the lead in organising the struggle which led to India’s independence. Although they were of
        varied ideologies ranging from moderates to extremists, their contribution to India’s freedom struggle has been
        immortalized in the minds of every Indian.</p>

                Born on 2nd October 1869, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is revered as Father of the Nation for his immense
                sacrifices for India. He not only ushered India towards freedom, but he also became the inspiring figure
                for many independence struggles and rights movements across the world. Popularly called Bapu, Gandhi
                introduced the doctrine of non-violence in India. According to him, independence was to be achieved
                through a combination of non-violent movement and non-co-operation with the British. His credit lies in
                the fact that he was able to bring the masses into the freedom struggle. The historic Non-Cooperation
                movement, Dandi March and the Quit India movement were all started under his leadership.

                Subhas Chandra Bose was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist and his ultimate
                patriotism carved a hero out of him. Bose belonged to the extremist section of the Indian freedom
                fighters. He was the leader of a radical youth wing of Congress from the early years of the 1920s till
                the end of 1930. Bose disagreed with the ideals of non-violence promoted by Gandhi, instead of believing
                that only armed revolt could oust the British from India. The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped
                the eyes of the British to ultimately reach Germany during the second world war. He raised the Indian
                National Army (INA) and with Japanese help, was able to free a portion of Indian territory from the
                British in Manipur, but was ultimately defeated due to Japanese surrender to the British. Although he is
                believed to have died in a plane crash in 1945, his death remains shrouded in mystery till date.

                approval of Gandhi, his mentor, rose to become one of the most dominant figures in Indian politics from
                the 1930s onwards. Nehru, after much deliberations, accepted the partition proposal for India in 1947
                and took oath as the First Prime Minister of India after attaining independence. His birthday on 14

                Born in 1907, Bhagat Singh was among the extreme revolutionary Indian freedom fighters. He was a largely
                controversial, though respected figure in the freedom struggle of India. This revolutionary hero was
                born in a Sikh family in the undivided state of Punjab and carried the legacy of his family and clinched
                to his patriotism till his death. He was involved in a plot in 1928 to assassinate James Scott, a
                British police superintendent to exact revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. The plot failed when
                they mistakenly killed another young police officer and Singh fled to Lahore to escape from punishment.
                The following year, he, along with his associates hurled a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in
                Delhi in protest against the implementation of the Defence of India Act and surrendered to the police.
                This great Indian freedom fighter was sentenced to death by hanging by the British, and executed at the
                age of only 23.

                field. Dadabhai Naoroji gained popularity for his famous opinion on the economic consequences of British
                rule in India. His opinion was unfavourable and he felt that the British rule would leave and cause
                irreparable damage to the Indian economy. In the years 1886, 1893 and 1906, Dadabhai Naoroji had the
                privilege of presiding over the annual sessions of the Indian National Congress. This later led to the

                Rule in India (1901). In this article, he was of the strong belief and opinion that India was taxed at a
                very high rate and all of India’s wealth was being drained to England.

                European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century. Through
                overwhelming military strength, the East India Company fought and annexed local kingdoms and established
                themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the
                Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades
                following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress
                Party, formed in 1885. The period after World War I was marked by colonial reforms such as the
                Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the unpopular Rowlatt Act and calls
                for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide
                non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.
                During the 1930s, the reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the
                resulting elections. The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War
                II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the
                All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The
                jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan</p>

            India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural
            heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since Independence. As the 7th largest country
            in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which
            give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches
            southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the
            east and the Arabian Sea on the west.
